## Trio
As someone that makes Discord bots on a regular basis, I've found it fairly tedious to have to write out the 'boilerplate' code to get one up and running.
To circumvent this, I've decided to create Trio, a [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) package working as a framework, using the powerful [Discord.JS](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js) library as a backbone.

As a result of using Discord.JS, we have the following going for us:
- Common and understandable syntax and function names,
- Amazing performance,
- Predictable abstractions, and
- 100% coverage of the Discord API
